## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- revise and get to know the importance of CSS reset
- fix the situation that img overflow its container by this:

```css
img {
  max-height: 100%;
}
```

- ðŸ‘€ the order: @import must show up before :root !

```css
@import url(//);

:root {
  //...
}
```

### Continued development

- ways to align images (background-image vs img)
